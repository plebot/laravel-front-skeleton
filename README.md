# Laravel Front Boilerplate

## Usage

### Where?

On a fresh Laravel install

### How?

- Clone repo to a temporary folder
- Copy its content
- Paste it into `resources` directory at the root of the Laravel project

## Dependencies

### Livereload

In `footer.blade.php`, there is a reference to LiveReload, because I use it on my projects, so the dependency is included in my `package.json` files

To use it, just follow those simple steps: https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/blob/master/docs/livereload.md

If you don't want to use it, just remove the reference in `footer.blade.php` ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
