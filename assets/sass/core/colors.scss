/**
 * Colors used across the website
 * ------------------------------
 * [1]
 * First let's name them as they should, using appropriate tool :
 * http://www.color-blindness.com/color-name-hue/
 * If two colors get the same name, use the built-in Sass functions :
 * darken($color-name, xx%)
 * lighten($color-name, xx%)
 *
 * [2]
 * Then, assign colors to their exact role, to allow easy updates
 * Do not hesitate to abuse of assignments, this is really healthy!
